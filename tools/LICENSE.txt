This Agreement shall be retained by Customer.  Customer may not sell, rent, assign, or lease the Software or any of its components and may not use the Software to print on non-Avery branded products.  Customer may not use the Software over an internal network or distribute the Software to Customer’s other computers over an internal network. Customer may not post the Software to any external web site. Customer may not transfer Customer’s rights under this Agreement.  Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or disassemble the Software in whole or in part.  The Software’s component parts may not be separated from the Software.  Customer may make one back-up copy of the Software for archival purposes only provided that such copy reproduces the entire Software, including all components, and reproduces and incorporates the complete legend found on the label of the original disk.  Customer may not copy the printed materials accompanying the Software. 

2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:  The Software is licensed, not sold.  The Software and its components are owned either by Avery or its subsidiaries or third-party suppliers, who retain all right, title, and interest in the Software or their respective components, and all copies thereof, and are therefore protected by United States patent and copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Customer shall treat the Software like any other patented and/or copyrighted material.  Certain patents may be pending.  Customer shall not remove, modify, or alter any patent, copyright, or trademark notice from any part of the Software.  All rights not specifically granted under this Agreement are reserved by Avery and/or its suppliers.

3. GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF CLIPART, PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND FONTS:  Customer may, subject to any restrictions set out below:

(a) Incorporate any clipart, photographic images, and fonts provided with the Software (collectively, Images) into Customer’s own original work and publish, display, and distribute Customer’s work in any media.  Customer may not, however, resell, sublicense, or otherwise make available the Images for use or distribution separately or detached from a product or web page.  For example, the Images may be used as part of a web page design, but may not be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or intended for permanent storage or re-use by others.

(b) Make one (1) copy of the Images for archival purposes.

Customer may not:  (i) create scandalous, obscene, defamatory, or immoral works using the Images nor use the Images for any other purpose which is prohibited by law; (ii) use or permit the use of the Images or any part thereof as a trademark or service mark, or claim any proprietary rights of any sort in the Images or any part thereof; (iii) use the Images in electronic format, on-line, or in multimedia applications unless the Images are incorporated for viewing purposes only and no permission is given to download and/or save the Images for any reason; (iv) rent, lease, sublicense, or lend the Images, or a copy thereof, to another person or legal entity (Customer may transfer all rights to use the Images to another person or legal entity, provided that Customer transfers all rights to the Software pursuant to Section 1 above); or (v) use any Images except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY:  Avery warrants that the CD-ROM media on which the Software is furnished will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt (Limited Warranty).  Any implied warranties on the Software, to the extent required by applicable law, are limited to ninety (90) days.  This Limited Warranty shall be void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.  This Limited Warranty does not apply to any copy of the Software, which shall be accepted AS IS, WHERE IS.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply.

5. CUSTOMER REMEDIES:  Avery’s entire liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy shall be replacement of the CD-ROM media that does not meet Avery’s Limited Warranty and that is returned to Avery at its Customer Service Center, 50 Pointe Drive, Brea, California 92821, U.S.A., with proof of purchase evidencing that the CD-ROM media is within the ninety (90)-day warranty period.  Any replacement Software shall be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  Outside the United States, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by Avery are available without proof of purchase from an authorized non-U.S. source.

6. NO OTHER WARRANTIES:  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY STATED ABOVE, AVERY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN MATERIALS.  AVERY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.  FURTHERMORE, AVERY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF ITS CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY AVERY OR AN AUTHORIZED AVERY REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  SOME JURISIDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO THE CUSTOMER

7. LIMITS OF LIABILITY:  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL AVERY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF AVERY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN ANY CASE, AVERY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER ALLOCABLE TO THE SOFTWARE.  BECAUSE SOME STATES/ JURISDICATIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.

HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES:  The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use or resale as an on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life-support machines, or weapons, in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (High Risk Activities).  Avery and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.
